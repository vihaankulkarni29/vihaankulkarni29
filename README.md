# Hi there, I'm Vihaan KulkarniðŸ‘‹



<img src="https://www.kapwing.com/tools/make/banner-image" width="100%">



I am a **bioinformatician** passionate about leveraging computational genomics to tackle one of the greatest global health challenges: **Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)**. I specialize in analyzing large-scale sequencing data to understand how pathogens evolve, spread, and develop resistance to treatment.

### ðŸ¦  AMR Research Focus



My primary interest lies in using Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data for:

* **Genomic Surveillance:** Tracking the spread of high-risk resistant clones (e.g., ESBL-producing *E. coli*).

* **Mechanism Discovery:** Identifying novel resistance genes and mutations in bacterial genomes.

* **Predictive Modeling:** Building models to predict antibiotic susceptibility from genotype data.
